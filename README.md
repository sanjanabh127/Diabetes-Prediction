# Diabetes Prediction â€” Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical data such as glucose level, BMI, age, and other health-related features.



## Overview
- Loads and preprocesses the diabetes dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes dataset).  
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.  
- Trains an **SVM classifier**.  
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics.  
- Makes predictions for new input data.
